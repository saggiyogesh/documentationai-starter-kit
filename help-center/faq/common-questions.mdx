## Organizing Documentation

Use the Projects feature to create separate spaces for each project.

1. Log in to your dashboard.
2. Click "Create Project".
3. Name your project (e.g., MyApp Docs).
4. Add pages for README, API, Guides, etc.

<Callout kind="tip">
Drag and drop pages to reorder them in your project.
</Callout>

You can also invite team members to collaborate on specific docs.
